This is the Car Insurance Rate comparison application

App summary:  Allow use to enter multiple desired vehicle information, home zip code, 
and dob which returns a relative rate as compared to all vehicles within the search request.

Light details:  Use third party API to return vehicle information.  Use another api to return rate information.
Use front end to obtain:

Vehicle Year:
User zip code:
User DOB:

Allow users to choose 2 to 4 vehicles.

After entering zip and DOB user initiates rate search.
Application returns insurance rates relative ONLY to the vehicles selected.

Why:  Car buyers have interest in knowing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) between 
multiple vehicles they are interested in purchasing.  There is no need for a specific quote, only to know that
Vehicle A would cost $X more or less than Vehicle B and how it relates to Vehicle C and D.
